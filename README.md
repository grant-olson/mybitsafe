MyBitSafe
=========

Source code for a failed bitcoin startup that intended to emulate
[ClearCoin](https://clearcoin.appspot.com), charging micropayments of
about 50 cents per transaction.  Apparently this was too expensive.

Testing is basically non-existant because all of the critical
functions and book-keeping happen within the bitcoin daemon and the
site was put up in a weekend.

Todo
----

Setup proper validations on all models.

Move global options to lib/Config.

DB indexes and what not.
