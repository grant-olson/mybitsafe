 Workflow.

1. User logs in.

2. Initiates payment to an address.

   + must get release address.
   + must create a unique 'account' for this.
   + must save account and tx info.

3. Deposits funds.

   + must detect this.  Set it in the db or just get it live?
   + gettransactions.  Save new ones to the db.

4. We take our rake.  But only 0.025 per 100 BTC.

   + Send rake offsite to me.
   + need to track cummulative amount, so we don't double charge.

5. Money sits there.

6. Released, or forfeit to charity.

   + Release funds from 'account' to address.
